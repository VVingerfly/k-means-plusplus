# k-means & k-means++ algorithms #
-------------------------------------

The C++ implementation of k-means and k-means++ algorithms, which is slightly modified from the code in [K-means++ clustering](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B_clustering).

The output is `*.eps`file, you can open it with [GSview](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/).
